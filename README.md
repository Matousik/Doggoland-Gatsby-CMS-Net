  Doggoland z.s., Gatsby implementation
</h1>

## üêï Doggoland z.s.

Doggoland z.s. is Czech non profit organization focused on rescuing dogs, cats and other animals from inadequate living conditions. I have co-counded this organization with my girlfriend, I am responsible for running our website and tiring hyperactive dogs through very long runs. :)

I have decided to implement this site again, now using Gatsby site generator to gain further experience in React based features in JS. As I am not the only one editing the website, I started this repository. I have decided to use Gatsby with styled-components to make website more modular and easy to correct in the future. I am also taking advantage of automatic page generation of dogs available for adoption and articles, both these categories of pages change frequently and constantly editing HTML pages can become more time consuming than just writing pure Markdown file as it is.
